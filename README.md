todo: 
    look at anti-corruption layer and see if I'm doing it right
    implement CQRS for retrieval of information
    UX/UI and eventual consistency compensating actions
    implement the rest of the functionality
    the only thing bothering me is the HTTP request we are using... should we set it up so that its an event fired after the reservation is booked?
